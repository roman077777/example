          Apostle of Speech proudly believes in the motto, silence unjustified - we stay true to our words, and speak of things that matter; your voice matters, the opinion inside you- will be heard, let’s think more, talk more, and make a change, however it is, whatever it maybe! Beautiful minds should not be caged; thoughts should not be compromised with the absence of sound. Silence is truly Unjustified.

        <p class="text">
          With the mantra “PASSION FOR FASHION”, Symphony has been the college's mark in the Fashion and Glamour world. The club has witnessed huge participation from the previous six years and had also won some laurels in fests and events. The best thing about Symphony is that it is not simply models strutting the runway but it always brings out a message through every show it has put up; be it Yin Yang which exhibited Contrasts of Human Nature, Festivals of India which took pride in the Cultural diversity of the country or Evolution of Bollywood.

          EAT SLEEP BHANGRA REPEAT. That's what we punjabis do! Punjabi By Nature, the official Bhangra Club of CCET, represents the culture and history of Punjab. PBN is committed to providing an enriching environment for self-expression, growth, and success. The core values we have learned to live by through dance are unity, love, and a sense of family. Since its foundation, the club has gained much recognition through its flash mobs and power packed performances.
